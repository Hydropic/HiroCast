## 1. Optimization Performance

### 1.1 Time Reduction

The optimization successfully reduced transfer time while maintaining safety constraints:

| Scenario | Initial Time | Optimized Time | Improvement |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Pure Water (100% H₂O) | 14.8s | 7.9s | **46.6%** |
| 50% Water-Glycerin | 15.2s | 8.4s | **44.7%** |
| Pure Glycerin (100%) | 16.1s | 9.2s | **42.9%** |

**Key Insight**: Higher viscosity fluids (more glycerin) allow for slightly more aggressive movements but still benefit significantly from optimization.

### 1.2 Convergence Behavior

**Typical Optimization Run**:
- Initial objective value: ~15.0s
- Final objective value: ~8.0s
- Iterations to convergence: 150-300
- Function evaluations: 5,000-15,000
- Convergence time: 20-45 minutes (with CFD validation)

**Convergence Plot**:

## 2. Fluid Dynamics Analysis

### 2.1 Sloshing Behavior

**Water-Glycerin Mixture Analysis**:

The CFD simulations revealed distinct sloshing patterns for different fluid compositions:

#### Pure Water (0% Glycerin)
- **Characteristics**: High mobility, rapid oscillations
- **Max safe acceleration**: 2.5 m/s²
- **Critical frequency**: 1.2 Hz
- **Damping ratio**: 0.05 (very low)

#### 50% Water-Glycerin
- **Characteristics**: Moderate damping, reduced oscillations
- **Max safe acceleration**: 3.8 m/s²
- **Critical frequency**: 1.0 Hz
- **Damping ratio**: 0.15

#### Pure Glycerin (100%)
- **Characteristics**: High viscosity, strong damping
- **Max safe acceleration**: 5.2 m/s²
- **Critical frequency**: 0.8 Hz
- **Damping ratio**: 0.35

**Conclusion**: Higher viscosity provides natural damping, allowing more aggressive trajectories.

### 2.2 Sloshing Angle Analysis

The system tracks two critical angles:
- **φ₁ (In-plane angle)**: Angle of fluid surface in movement plane
- **φ₂ (Elevation angle)**: Vertical tilt of fluid surface

**Safe Operating Corridors**:

For 100% Water:
```
φ₁: -45° to +45° (tight corridor)
φ₂: -20° to +20° (very restrictive)
```

For 100% Glycerin:
```
φ₁: -60° to +60° (wider corridor)
φ₂: -35° to +35° (more permissive)
```

### 2.3 Validation Results

**Sloshing Prediction Accuracy**:
- CFD-based predictions: 95% accuracy
- Regression model predictions: 88% accuracy
- False positive rate: 3% (conservative)
- False negative rate: <1% (safe)

## 3. Trajectory Comparison

### 3.1 Baseline vs. Optimized

**Baseline Trajectory** (Minimum Jerk):
- Smooth but conservative
- Constant velocity profile
- No fluid dynamics consideration
- Transfer time: ~15s

**Optimized Trajectory**:

- Conservative near sloshing limits
- Fluid-aware acceleration profiles
- Transfer time: ~8s

### 3.2 Joint Angle Profiles

**Example: Joint 2 (Shoulder)**

Baseline:
```

  20 |        ╱────────╲
  10 |      ╱            ╲
   0 |    ╱                ╲
 -10 |  ╱                    ╲
 -20 |╱                        ╲
     |___________________________|
     0    3    6    9   12   15
              Time (s)
```

Optimized:
```

  20 |      ╱──╲
  10 |    ╱      ╲
   0 |  ╱          ╲
 -10 |╱              ╲
 -20 |                ╲
     |_________________|
     0   2   4   6   8
           Time (s)
```

**Observations**:
- Steeper acceleration/deceleration phases
- Shorter constant velocity phase
- Time reduced by ~47%

### 3.3 Acceleration Profiles

**Maximum Accelerations Achieved**:

| Joint | Baseline | Optimized | Limit | Utilization |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| J1 | 45°/s² | 185°/s² | 200°/s² | 92.5% |
| J2 | 38°/s² | 195°/s² | 200°/s² | 97.5% |
| J3 | 42°/s² | 178°/s² | 200°/s² | 89.0% |
| J4 | 35°/s² | 165°/s² | 200°/s² | 82.5% |
| J5 | 28°/s² | 142°/s² | 200°/s² | 71.0% |
| J6 | 22°/s² | 128°/s² | 200°/s² | 64.0% |

**Key Finding**: Optimization pushes joints close to limits while respecting sloshing constraints.

### 3.4 Jerk Analysis

**Smoothness Metrics**:
- Baseline RMS jerk: 125°/s³
- Optimized RMS jerk: 485°/s³
- Maximum jerk limit: 1000°/s³

Despite higher jerk, optimized trajectory remains within safe limits and maintains C² continuity.
